INTRODUCTION

Anemia, a condition characterized by a deficiency of red blood cells or hemoglobin, affects millions of individuals worldwide, leading to fatigue, weakness, and more severe health issues if left untreated.

Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective management and treatment. Leveraging the power of machine learning, this project aims to develop a predictive model for anemia, utilizing a diverse dataset of clinical parameters.

By identifying patterns and correlations within the data, the model seeks to provide a reliable, non-invasive tool for early anemia detection, ultimately improving patient outcomes and enhancing healthcare efficiency.

The main objective of this project is to Predict Anaemia from Image Pixels and Hemoglobin Levels.

Dataset Description:

This dataset is curated to facilitate the development of machine learning models aimed at predicting Anaemia from Image Pixels and Hemoglobin Levels.

Dataset Description:

This dataset is curated to facilitate the development of machine learning models aimed at predicting anaemia based on hemoglobin levels and color pixel distribution from associated images. Each row in the dataset corresponds to an individual case with various features

Columns:

Number: Type: Integer Description: A unique identifier for each individual case.

Sex: Type: Categorical (Male, Female) Description: The sex of the individual. %Red Pixel: Type: Float Description: The percentage of red pixels in the image associated with the case.

%Green Pixel: Type: Float Description: The percentage of green pixels in the image associated with the case.

%Blue Pixel: Type: Float Description: The percentage of blue pixels in the image associated with the case.

Hb: Type: Float Description: Hemoglobin level of the individual, measured in grams per deciliter (g/dL).

Anaemic: Type:Catagorical (Yes | No ) Description: An indicator of anaemia status (1 for anaemic, 0 for not anaemic).
